    question: "What is Medify?",
    answer: "Medify is an emergency health card generator that creates a personalized health card linked to a static QR code. When scanned, the QR code provides life-saving medical information instantly."
  },
  {
    question: "How does Medify work?",
    answer: (
      <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-5">
        <li>Users log in using their Google account (or email/password).</li>
        <li>First-time users fill in their medical and personal details.</li>
        <li>Medify generates a printable health card with a static QR code.</li>
        <li>Users can update their details anytime by revisiting the website.</li>
        <li>The QR code always remains the same.</li>
      </ul>
    )
  },
  {
    question: "Can I update my health details after creating the card?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-1">
        <p className="flex items-center"><CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 text-green-500 mr-2 flex-shrink-0" /> Yes, you can update your information anytime by logging in again with the same account.</p>
        <p className="flex items-center"><XCircle className="w-4 h-4 text-red-500 mr-2 flex-shrink-0" /> The QR code does not change after updates.</p>
      </div>
    )
  },
  {
    question: "Is my data secure?",
    answer: "Yes. Medify uses secure authentication and privacy-focused storage via Supabase. Your data is accessible in read-only format when scanned, and only you can edit it after logging in."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to create a new card if I update my information?",
    answer: "No. You can continue using your existing printed card because the QR code remains unchanged. When scanned, the most recent updated information will automatically appear."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost?",
    answer: (
      <p className="flex items-center"><CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 text-green-500 mr-2 flex-shrink-0" /> Medify is absolutely free for all users. You can generate, download, and update your emergency health card at no cost.</p>
    )
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I lose my printed card?",
    answer: "You can simply log in again and reprint your health card. The QR code linked to your account will remain the same."
  },
  {
    question: "Who can access my information?",
    answer: "Only those who scan your QR code can view your emergency health details. They will have read-only access â€“ no one can modify your information except you."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to install any app?",
    answer: "No. Medify is a web-based platform. You only need internet access to create or update your card. Your QR code works to display info when scanned (if the scanner has internet)."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use Medify for family members?",
    answer: "Currently, one card is linked to one account. For family members, you would need separate logins/accounts."
